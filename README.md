# Simulating Quantum Algorithms using Python

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Python framework for simulating quantum computing and its associated algorithms. The framework provides tools to model qubits, quantum gates, quantum states, and operations such as superdense coding and quantum teleportation. The code is designed to be modular, making it easy to extend and integrate with other quantum algorithms and tools.

### Features:
- **State Class**: Provides methods for creating and manipulating quantum states.
- **Tensor Class**: Implements various tensor operations for quantum computing.
- **Operator Class**: Implements quantum gates and operations such as Pauli-X, Pauli-Z, Hadamard, and more.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Includes implementations of algorithms like quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and more.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for generating states, measuring qubits, etc.
